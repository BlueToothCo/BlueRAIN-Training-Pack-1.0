## User Guide

### Bluetooth™ Connection

To ensure optimal Bluetooth™ connectivity, ensure that your device is within range (typically up to 30 feet / 10 meters) of the Bluetooth™-enabled neurostimulation hardware. Interference from walls, other wireless devices, or physical obstructions may reduce signal strength and hinder performance.

### Training Session Overview

Each training session is composed of the following stages:

1. **Warm-Up Phase**  
   The initial phase focuses on calibrating the neural interface. The device will send low-frequency signals to ensure a stable connection and baseline readings.

2. **Cognitive Engagement Phase**  
   During this phase, users will engage in mental exercises designed to target specific cognitive skills, such as memory recall or logical reasoning. The system will adjust signal frequencies in real-time based on brainwave activity, ensuring optimal training conditions.

3. **Feedback and Analysis Phase**  
   After completing the cognitive exercises, users will receive detailed feedback on their performance. This phase includes a breakdown of brainwave patterns, highlighting areas of strength and opportunities for improvement.

4. **Cooldown Phase**  
   The cooldown phase helps the brain return to a balanced state, reducing mental fatigue and reinforcing newly acquired cognitive patterns.

### Troubleshooting

- **Connectivity Issues**:  
  If the Bluetooth™ connection fails to establish or is interrupted during training, ensure that the neurostimulation device is within range and that no other devices are competing for the Bluetooth™ signal. Restart the application and try reconnecting.

- **Performance Delays**:  
  Ensure that your device meets the minimum system requirements. Closing unnecessary applications or freeing up system resources may help improve performance.

## Advanced Usage

For advanced users, BlueRAIN™ Training Pack 1.0 offers the ability to fine-tune training parameters manually. This includes adjusting the signal strength, frequency ranges, and duration of each training phase. Expert users can create custom training regimens tailored to specific cognitive goals.

## Security and Privacy

BlueRAIN™ prioritizes user data security. All training data is encrypted and stored securely in the cloud. The application adheres to GDPR compliance standards to protect user privacy and ensure that data is handled in accordance with global privacy regulations.

## Conclusion

Unfortunately, due to unforeseen and critical issues, the BlueRAIN™ Training Pack 1.0 project has been discontinued. Despite extensive testing and development, the program was associated with an alarmingly high mortality rate of 67% among users. After thorough investigations, it was determined that the risks posed by the technology outweighed its potential benefits. We deeply regret the inconvenience caused and advise all current users to cease further use immediately. The safety and well-being of our users remain our top priority, and we are committed to learning from this experience to ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future.
